This slider uses Swiper JS for the slider functionality and GSAP for the snimstion.

The animation is a clip path transition from one slide to the next. The fruit elements are also animated when the slide changes.

Object clip and blending modes have been used to lay the labels (jpeg) onto the cans. A translate of the image labels along the X axis simulates 3D rotation.
